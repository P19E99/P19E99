## 👋 Hi there, I'm P19E99🐷

🎓 Undergraduate @ Zhengzhou University | 🔐 Information Security | 🤖 AI Security Research

Hi! I'm an undergraduate student majoring in **Information Security** at **Zhengzhou University**. I used to be a competitive programming contestant, and now I'm working on **AI security–related research**. I enjoy both thinking about theoretical problems and getting my hands dirty with experiments.

## 🔍 Research Interests

My current research focuses on **unlearnable examples** — specifically, using them to **prevent generative models from learning personal data during fine-tuning**, as a way to protect privacy.

I'm generally interested in topics like:

* AI privacy & data protection
* Unlearnable / adversarial examples
* Security and robustness of generative models

If you're working on something related, feel free to reach out and chat 🙂

## 🧠 Competitive Programming

Before doing research, I spent quite some time on algorithm contests:

* 🥉 **ICPC Asia Regional Contest** — Bronze Medal
* 🥇 **CCPC National Invitational Contest** — Gold Medal

If you're a beginner who wants to get into competitive programming but don’t know where to start (or how to train efficiently), I’m happy to help.

## 🛠 Skills

* Languages: C++, Python
* Keywords: Machine Learning, AI Security, Fine-tuning, Privacy Protection
* Tools: PyTorch and common ML research tools

## 🐽 Fun Facts

I really like **pet pigs** 🐖 — and honestly, most things related to pigs. If you like pigs too, we’ll probably get along well.
